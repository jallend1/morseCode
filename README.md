# Morse Code Key

Just a quick little web app that lets you hold down the spacebar, and generates Morse Code based on the length of time you've held it down.

After a break, the app will combine the characters you have pressed into a letter.

If the break is longer, it will assume you are starting a new word and add a space.

All unrecognized combinations of dits and dahs are represented with a question mark.

## Possible update ideas?

- Adjust time intervals to something more official instead of what "felt" right
- Adjustable time frames based on Morse code skill level

Any feedback, tips, suggestions, are greatly appreciated!
